# 📚 AI PDF Question-Answering System (FastAPI + Streamlit + Claude 3.5)

This project is a full-stack RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline where users can upload a PDF document, and then ask questions about it.  
The system retrieves the most relevant sections of the document using semantic search and generates natural language answers using Claude 3.5 Haiku.

✅ Built with **FastAPI** backend and **Streamlit** frontend.  
✅ Uses **real embeddings** (MiniLM or BGE) and **FAISS** vector database.  
✅ Answers generated with **Anthropic Claude 3.5** model.
